Dependency injection by pattern

Swift dependency injection is difficult compared to the possibilies in Java EE and Android, this project demonstrates how to handle this with a pattern, and with cuckoo we get nice testable mocks (like with mockito).

Todo: 
 - make the injection / providing part generic, to avoid boilerplate code, when adding more services.
